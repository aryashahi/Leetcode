travelling inorder, and stroing the nodes in a vector using recursion
​
and then made a random node and started attaching nodes to its right and traversal through it till all nodes are attached.
​
​
improvement -
on need to think to attach a left NULL node, as the compiler automatically autofills the absent nodes as NULL.
